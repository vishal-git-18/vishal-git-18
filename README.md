## 👋 Hey, I'm Vishal Ravishankar

I’m a passionate **Software Developer** who loves building **end-to-end systems** that solve real problems — often ones I’ve personally faced or wanted to simplify.  
Whether it’s creating tools that streamline workflows or designing products that make data meaningful, I enjoy turning ideas into **reliable, impactful software**.

💡 My internships at **Inube** and **UrbanPro** gave me a balance of exploration and depth — from experimenting with **AI to automate tasks** to mastering how **scalable, maintainable systems** are built.  
They taught me to think critically about technology choices and design for **long-term impact**.

🤝 I really enjoy collaborating with others — working in a team lets me learn from different perspectives, exchange ideas, and grow faster as a developer.  
If you’re working on something exciting or have an idea worth exploring, **hit me up** — I’d love to build and learn together.
